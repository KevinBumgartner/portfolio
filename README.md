A demonstration of coding, algorithmic, and mathematical skills.

How to use this repository:
  If you're interested in taking a peek at my code, it might be wise
to begin by reading the contents of the file "01-Snippets.code" - this
file contains short, mostly self-contained snippets written in Python,
R and Julia.  If this whets your appetite for more, then you might
enjoy reading some of the more in-depth files; I'm providing a file
with some matrix factorization algorithms written in Julia, and
a file with some data cleaning and plumbing code written in R. In the
near future, I'll be adding to this repository a file with some 
self-designing neural network code written in Python, and
a directory with several C++ files for a very basic symbolic manipulator
(computer algebra system) backend.
